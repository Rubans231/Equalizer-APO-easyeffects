# Easyeffects

- Has all kinds of audio manipulation options including equalizer to enhance pipewire audio in arch linux
- Can simply install it from flatpak and go bonkers on the audio customization to suit our liking
- The currently saved presets are for my JBL Quantum 910 
- I personally use it on 71% volume (mildly blasting my ears into oblivion because it's fun)

Currently using spatial audio configured into pipewire and the "perfectly balanced" eq works pretty well for "take me to the beach" and "No title"
Trebble and bass was good for ado while in DTS
